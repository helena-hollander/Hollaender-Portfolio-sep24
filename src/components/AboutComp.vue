('Hello World!')<br>My name is Helena, I am 24 and currently studying Coded Design at DMJX in Copenhagen. My creative process is often messy and vibrant. I love to work with different mediums such as creative coding, illustration, painting, animation and 3D. Bold and beautiful stage design and quirky story-lines are a passion of mine.<br>My dream is to find like-minded people and create immersive digital experiences.<br><br>Please get in touch and let's get cooking!</p>
